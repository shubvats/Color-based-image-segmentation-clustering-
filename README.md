Project Color-Based Image Segmentation: 
Developed an image segmentation system that segments images based on color. 
This project involved implementing algorithms to partition an image into distinct regions with similar color properties. 
Using techniques like k-means clustering and color space transformations, I was able to accurately segment objects within the images. 
This project demonstrated my ability to apply advanced image processing methods to practical problems, 
It Will help you enhancing skills relevant to computer vision and digital image analysis.
